        About Alphine AI
      </h1>

      <p className="max-w-4xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-8">
        Alphine AI was founded on a single belief — that **transparency and truth in human
        participation** should be measurable, verifiable, and available to everyone. Across the
        world, events and gatherings define movements, shape policies, and tell stories of
        collective power. Yet, even today, society relies on **guesses and approximations** to
        determine how many people truly participated. Alphine AI is here to change that.
      </p>

      <p className="max-w-4xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-8">
        Using a fusion of **AI vision systems**, **geolocation intelligence**, **satellite data**, and
        **secure crowd analytics**, we bring clarity to the world’s largest gatherings — whether
        physical or virtual. Our mission is to ensure that numbers reflect reality, enabling
        journalists, governments, researchers, and citizens to rely on verified attendance data
        rather than speculation.
      </p>

      <p className="max-w-4xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        Alphine AI is more than a technology company; it is a commitment to the future of public
        integrity. Every rally, festival, conference, and community event deserves accurate
        representation. Our work empowers data-driven governance, responsible event management,
        and honest storytelling — all through ethical, privacy-first AI.
