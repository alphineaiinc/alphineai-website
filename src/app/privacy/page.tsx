        Alphine AI follows a strict security-first design philosophy. We practice least-privilege access,
        encryption in transit and at rest, and minimized data retention by default. Our systems are audited
        periodically for compliance and reliability. A full privacy documentation page will be added soon
        to explain data handling, consent, and user control measures.
